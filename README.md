IOS Swift Class - Making a tap game.

Thanks to Devslope for the great Udemy class on IOS9 & Swift

This is a basic tap game.

Game completed 21:20 11-8-2015

this project was to learn how to lay out the UI on different IOS devices.
Take input of number of times to click on the coin to end the game.
Reset game when done.

Just a basic app, but a great learning tool for a beginner like me.
